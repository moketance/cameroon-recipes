        <li>3-4 tablespoon (42ml-56ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced (red or white onion)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon (1.6g) fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon (1g) dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (8g) garlic, or 2½ teaspoon (9.7g) garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 cup (591g) rice, long-grain, uncooked rice (I used basmati)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (7g) paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon (4g) chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 14-ounce can tomato puree or sauce</li>
        <li>4 cup (1,000ml) chicken broth or water, 5¼ cups for stovetop</li>
        <li>1 Scotch bonnet pepper, or ¾ teaspoon hot pepper (omit if cooking for kids)</li>
        <li>1 pound (453.59g) vegetables, peas, carrots, green beans, or corn (optional)</li>
        <li>Parsley, for garnishing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Baking Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350℉/177℃. Rinse the rice with water and drain.</li>
        <li>In a half-sheet pan (approx. 13"x18"x 2½"), combine all ingredients and stir so that everything is fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly with aluminum foil paper. Double the foil if you can because it helps cook faster.</li>
        <li>Gently place in the oven and cook for about 70-80 minutes. Carefully remove from the oven and check after 70 minutes. Since posting, I have retried the recipe several times, and it works best for my oven after 75 minutes.</li>
        <li>When cooked, remove carefully from the oven and let it rest for about 5 minutes. Then carefully remove the aluminum paper. Fluff rice with a fork, throw in your add-ins, and mix evenly. Serve warm.</li>
        
    </ol>

    <h4>Stovetop Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse rice and drain.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Next, add onions, thyme, and garlic, cook for about 2 minutes or until the onion becomes soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add rice, season with paprika, bouillon, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring often until fragrant, for about 30 seconds, and brown occasionally stirring, for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour tomatoes sauce, chicken broth, and hot pepper, if any, into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, stirring once or twice. Reduce heat to low, cover saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, for 15-18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from heat, let it sit covered for 5 minutes, then fluff rice with a fork or serving spoon. Then throw in sauteed veggies and beef, chicken, and shrimp (if desired) and mix.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
