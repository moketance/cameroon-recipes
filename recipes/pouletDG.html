    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, 3½ to 4 pounds, skin on and cut into small chunks</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1½ cup parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1½ cup celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>1 bulb garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>¾-1 cup oil</li>
        <li>1 pound carrots, cut into ½ inch slices (frozen preferable)</li>
        <li>1 pound green beans, cut (I used frozen)</li>
        <li>2-3 green peppers</li>
        <li>5-6 plantains, medium ripe</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Maggie or chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>Oil, for deep frying the plantains</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken on both sides with a tablespoon of salt and 1½ tablespoon of pepper. Preheat a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup of oil to the pot. Add half the chicken and fry it, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes total, and transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken, or you can place all the chicken in the pot as I did and let it brown for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Blend the onions, parsley, celery, tomato, and garlic in a food processor or blender into a fine paste. Pour all the mixture into the pot, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Add Maggie or chicken bouillon, occasionally stirring, for 8-10 minutes. Add about ½ a cup of water if needed.</li>
        <li>Mix the carrots and green beans into the pot of chicken; let it simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Finally, add the green peppers, stir and let them blend, turn off the stove.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, cut both ends off the plantain. This will make it easy to grab the plantain skin. Slit a shallow line down the long seam of the plantain only as deep as the peel. Remove plantain peel by pulling it back.</li>
        <li>Cut plantains into rounds about an inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or cast iron with oil up to ½ inch deep on medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Fry the plantains until golden brown, then toss them with the chicken and vegetable medley. But hold off on this until you are ready to serve the meal.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
